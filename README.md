# Fix Hebrew subtitles encoding

This is a python script, so you need python to use it.
I tested it with Python 3 but it might work with Python 2 as well.

To use it you need to make sure `fixsub.bat` is in your path.
You can either add its directory to path or copy the file/create a link to
it in a folder that's already in the path.

The bat file has fixsub.py script embedded inside so it's a standalone script.
