Scripts that I use to download movies for a non-techy friend.

Contains a script to fix Hebrew subtitle encoding, and a script to convert MKV files to MP4 (his Samsung TV won't play any other format).

* You need python installed and addd to PATH to use the encoding script.
* You need ffmpeg installed and addd to PATH to use the converter script.

You can then add all the scripts in this repo to PATH aswell,
so you can just type the name of each script in the path bar in the explorer and it will operate on the files in the current directory.
