Scripts that I use to download movies for a friend.

Contains the following scripts:

* `fixsub.bat` - Fix Hebrew subtitle encoding.
* `mp4.bat` - Convert video files to MP4 (his Samsung TV won't play any other format).
* `x264.bat` - Re-encode video files to x264.
* `matchsubs.bat` - Rename all subtitle files in a directory to match each episode of a series.

To use the scripts, you need to install Python and ffmpeg (make sure they're also added to PATH).
You can then add this repo to PATH as well, so you can just type the name of each script in the path bar in the explorer and it will operate on the files in the current directory.
